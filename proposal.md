# Title
Thomas Cannon Final Project Proposal // Gaming

## Repository
(https://github.com/tcannon469/ANGM-FInal-Project-Proposal.git)

## Description
I intend to create a short little interactive video-game, the specifity of what it'll be like is to be determined. It will display knowledge from digital image creation through programming.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- A character will move across a screen, scrolling optional
- Feature 2
	- Backgrounds will be imported and displayed in correct resolutions
- Feature N 
	- An achievable goal will end the program, the specifics of which to be determined

## Challenges
- Interactive control in python for game movement must be learned
- Persistent optimization techniques must be further learned as shown in a prior lab

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A short, tiny game segment playable from beginning to end at a stable performance

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- To get interactive components up and functional, even without design elements implemented

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Research Phase
  2. Begin looking into bare essentials to get interactive controls

- Week 2
  1. Program further on interactivity
  2. Start optimizing

- Week N (Final)
  1. Finalize work into something presentable even if it doesn't meet the entirety of the concept
  2. Make something playable
